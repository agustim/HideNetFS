Net Files
----------  
  Fields
  - fileid, a random string that represents the whole file.
  - partid, a string of the form 'partX' where is is some positive integer.
  - path,   the path to the file on the disk.
  
  Provides functions used to load information about files from and dump said information to
  a local file. Also supports splitting and joining of files so that they can be distributed
  across the network and rebuilt after being retrieved.

  Note that, on the disk, files are stored in the format PATH/FILEID|PARTID (| => concatenate).

Node
-----
  Fields
  - address,    the IP identifying the node.
  - neighbours, maps nodes connected to to the socket they communicate through.
  - files,      maps fileids to the Net File representing it.
  - owned,      maps file descriptors (names?) of the user's files to fileids to retrieve.
  - lastPing,   time since the last ping message was sent out informing network of activity.

  Represents the computer as a node in the network. Each node stores information about the
  nodes it is connected to in order to communicate, information about the files it is storing
  for other users, information about the files owned by this node's user, and the time since
  the node last sent a ping to its neighbours to inform the network it is still active.
